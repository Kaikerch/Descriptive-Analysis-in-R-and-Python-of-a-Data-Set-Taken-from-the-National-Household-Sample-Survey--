# Descriptive Analysis in R and Python of a Data Set Taken from the National Household Sample Survey - 2015 by IBGE

> Status: Concluded

In this project, in Google Colaboratory, I descriptively analyzed a database obtained from the National Household Sample Survey carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics in 2015 using the R language and the Python language. The National Household Sample Survey annually investigates general characteristics of the population, education, work, income and housing and others, with varying frequency, according to the information needs of the country, such as characteristics on migration, fertility, marriage, health, food security, among other topics. The survey of these statistics constitutes an important tool for the formulation, validation and evaluation of policies aimed at socioeconomic development and the improvement of living conditions in Brazil.
*Step by step:
- First I characterized the dataset that I would use in the project.
- I imported the pandas, numpy and seaborn libraries, as I used these libraries.
- I created and visualized the dataframe with the dataset I used.
- I created the ranges and labels of the classes and with that I created the column of frequencies and percentages, in this way, I managed to create an income distribution table.
- I built a bar graph to visualize the frequency table information and wrote the conclusion I had when analyzing the data.
- I created a histogram for the quantitative variables in the dataset and wrote the conclusion I had when analyzing the data.
- For reference, I built a histogram with only the information of people with income up to R$ 20,000.00.
- I created a table of frequencies and one with the percentages of crossing the variables "sex" and "color" and wrote the conclusion I had when analyzing the data.
- I did a descriptive analysis only of the variable "income", and then, relating this variable to the variables "sex" and "color", and wrote the conclusion I had when analyzing the data.
- I built a box plot of the variable "income" relating this variable to the variables "sex" and "color" and wrote the conclusion I had when analyzing the data.
- For reference, I obtained the percentage of people earning a minimum wage or less and the maximum amount earned by 99% of people.
- I performed a descriptive analysis of the "income" variable, relating this variable to the variables "years of study" and "sex" and to the variable "states of the federation", and I wrote the conclusion I had when analyzing the data.
- I constructed a box plot of the variable "income" relating this variable to the variables "years of study" and "sex" and of the variable "income" relating this variable to the variable "units of the federation", and I wrote the conclusion I had to the analyze the data.
